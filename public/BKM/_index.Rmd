[Hugo-theme-learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn) is a very good theme for building documentation sites. The R [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package makes it very easy to create blogs and websites with R Markdown language. This site is to show how to use **blogdown** with the **hugo-theme-learn** theme to quickly build a documentation site.

Open RStudio, click **File->New Project-> New Directory -> Website using blogdown**.

Uncheck the option **Add sample blog posts** and **Add the example site of the theme** so that we can start with a very basic website.

Instead of using the official **matcornic/hugo-theme-learn** theme, we are going to use a fork of that theme: **MingChen0919/hugo-theme-learn**. The original theme displays all R Markdown content at very low opacity, which makes it almost unreadable. This issue has been fixed in the forked theme.
