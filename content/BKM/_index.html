<p><a href="https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn">Hugo-theme-learn</a> is a very good theme for building documentation sites. The R <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> package makes it very easy to create blogs and websites with R Markdown language. This site is to show how to use <strong>blogdown</strong> with the <strong>hugo-theme-learn</strong> theme to quickly build a documentation site.</p>
<p>Open RStudio, click <strong>File-&gt;New Project-&gt; New Directory -&gt; Website using blogdown</strong>.</p>
<p>Uncheck the option <strong>Add sample blog posts</strong> and <strong>Add the example site of the theme</strong> so that we can start with a very basic website.</p>
<p>Instead of using the official <strong>matcornic/hugo-theme-learn</strong> theme, we are going to use a fork of that theme: <strong>MingChen0919/hugo-theme-learn</strong>. The original theme displays all R Markdown content at very low opacity, which makes it almost unreadable. This issue has been fixed in the forked theme.</p>
